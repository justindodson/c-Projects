# Movie Tracker Project

The movie tracker project is the first project for practicing OOP in C++. This project features the basic of 
constructor creation, public and private methods, using raw pointers in methods. Although explored, there is 
no implementation of custom destructors, copy constructors, or move constructors. These will be more heavily 
explored in later projects and assignments.

# Movie Tracker Project Description

There are 2 classes created here: the Movie class and the Movies class

The Movie class models a simple movie, the title, rating, and number of times watched. 
The Movies class simply models a collection of all the movies created for that collection. The Movies class also
holds the primary operators of the program. The functionality is all called through the Movies class where you can 
create movies and add the to the collection, "watch" movies, and display all of your movies and movie information.

Although simple, this project can be extended to have a menu interface for the user as well as a database backend to 
persist the data created by the user.
